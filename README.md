## LangGraph Glossary

State
- The state is a shared data structure that holds the current information or context of the entire application
- In simple terms, its like the app's memory, keeping track  of the variables and data that nodes can access and modify as they execute

Nodes
- Are individual functions or operations that perform specific tasks within the graph
- Each node receives input (often the current state). processes it, and produces and output or an updated state
- Start node is a virtual entry point in LangGraph, marking where the workflow begins
- End node signifies the conclusion of the workflow
- Tool nodes are special kind of nodes whose main job is to run a tool

Graph
- A graph (in LangGraph) is the overarching structure that maps out how different tasks (nodes) are connected and executed
- It visually represents the workflow, showing the sequence and conditional paths between various operations

Edges
- Connections between nodes that determine the flow of execution
- Tell us which node should be executed next after current one completes its task
- There are conditional edges as well

Tools
- specialized functions or utilities that nodes can utilize to perform specific tasks such as fetching data from an API
- Nodes are 

StateGraph
- is a class in langgraph used to build and compile the graph structure
- manages nodes, edges, and overall state

Runnable
- standardized, executable component that performs a specific task within an AI workflow
- serves as a funfamental building block, allowing for us to create modular systems

Messages
- Human Message: input from user
- System Message: used to provide instructions or context to model
- Function Message: Represents the result of a function call
- AI Message: responsed generated by AI models
- Tool Message: similar to function message, but specific to tool usage
